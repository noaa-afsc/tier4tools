\title{Arrange SPR decomposition plots into report-ready grid}
\usage{
grid_spr_decomp(
  plots,
  order = NULL,
  ncol = 1,
  nrow = NULL,
  guides = c("collect", "keep"),
  title = NULL,
  caption = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plots}{A named list of ggplot objects returned by \code{plot_spr_decomp()}.}

\item{order}{Character vector giving the plot names (in \code{plots}) in the order to arrange.
Defaults to \code{c("contrib","removed","removed_prop","survivorship")} when present,
otherwise \code{names(plots)}.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in the grid.}

\item{nrow}{Optional number of rows. If \code{NULL}, patchwork chooses automatically.}

\item{guides}{Passed to \code{patchwork::plot_layout(guides = ...)}. Default \code{"collect"} collects legends when possible.}

\item{title}{Optional figure title (character). Added with \code{patchwork::plot_annotation()}.}

\item{caption}{Optional figure caption (character). Added with \code{patchwork::plot_annotation()}.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object (a ggplot-like object) that can be printed or saved.
}
\description{
Combined list output from \code{plot_spr_decomp()} into a single multipanel
figure using \pkg{patchwork}. Because \pkg{patchwork} is in Suggests, this
function will only run when it is installed.

Typical usage:
\preformatted{
  decomp_plots <- plot_spr_decomp(spr_out, drop_plus_from_plot = TRUE)
  grid_spr_decomp(decomp_plots, order = c("contrib","removed","survivorship"), ncol = 1)
}
