\title{Arrange SPR input plots into a report-ready grid}
\usage{
grid_spr_inputs(
  plots,
  order = NULL,
  ncol = 1,
  nrow = NULL,
  guides = c("collect", "keep"),
  title = NULL,
  caption = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plots}{A named list of ggplot objects returned by \code{plot_spr_inputs()}.}

\item{order}{Character vector giving the plot names (in \code{plots}) in the order to arrange.
Defaults to \code{names(plots)}.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in the grid.}

\item{nrow}{Optional number of rows. If \code{NULL}, patchwork chooses automatically.}

\item{guides}{Passed to \code{patchwork::plot_layout(guides = ...)}. Default \code{"collect"}
collects legends when possible.}

\item{title}{Optional figure title (character). Added with \code{patchwork::plot_annotation()}.}

\item{caption}{Optional figure caption (character). Added with \code{patchwork::plot_annotation()}.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object (a ggplot-like object) that can be printed or saved.
}
\description{
Combine list output from \code{plot_spr_inputs()} into a multi-panel figure
using \pkg{patchwork}. Because \pkg{patchwork} is in Suggests, this function
will only run when it is installed.

\details{
Typical usage:
\preformatted{
  inp_plots <- plot_spr_inputs(inp, panels = c("mat_selex","wt","len","M"))
  grid_spr_inputs(inp_plots, order = c("mat_selex","wt","len","M"), ncol = 1)
}
}
